# 遊戲編劇AI神助手 HW 06

## 第一步
發想過程，套用最近的主題：超導體

細節在[對話過程1](./01st/chat.html)，包含：
* 定義科技狀態
  * 量子電腦、AGI、核融合......
* 創造社群光譜
  * 不義肢化-全身義肢化
    * ex: 不義肢化的人僅使用EEG，全身義體化的直接使用腦機介面。除了前述極端狀況，大部分的人是部分神經連結和部分義肢
  * 現實生活-網路世代
    * ex: 完全網路生活的人僅在虛擬世界，完全現實生活的人還是以現實為主。除了前述極端狀況，大部分的人是一部分生活在現實與虛擬多重身分生活
* 基於此再讓[AI補足科技史](./02nd/chat.html)

## 第二步
發想過程[小說化](./02nd/chat.html)，塑造一種破壞的概念，由此來推進類似正邪對抗的劇情

此段落可用來當作遊戲第一場景，遊戲可能是2D platform ARPG類型 競品類似楓之谷的操作  
考量到手機遊戲可能是類似雷電X直式戰鬥畫面，然後逃跑過程切換類似Temple Run的跑酷模式  

基本世界畫風為超導世界後的科幻(UI會以科幻風為主)，比如有磁浮列車可以快速換地圖  
但是又有虛擬世界連結器可以登入虛擬世界，類似SAO  
虛擬世界就不限世界類型，可能是魔法結合cyberpunk、可能是蒸氣龐克結合陰陽術

現實生活是基本的體力、智力、社交力等數值  
進到虛擬世界是裝備為主的世界，要提升能力都是透過分解合成新裝備  
(類似persona現實是五維而迷宮是戰鬥數值)

## 第三步

### 第一章

The Nexus Arena was a blazing cauldron of energy, its virtual boundaries pulsing with the combined might of the world's greatest spellcasters. The crowd roared, a synthesized symphony of excitement that resonated through the very core of the virtual world. Neon banners with sponsors' logos and virtual fireworks adorned the sky, adding to the spectacle.

In the center of it all stood our protagonist, his eyes narrowed, his metal arm gleaming under the simulated sunlight. His name was Kael, a name that had become synonymous with victory in the brutal realm of virtual dueling. A veteran of the Nexus Game, his reputation extended from the bustling technological hub of Nexus City to the shadowy underbelly of the Undercity.

His opponent, a mysterious sorceress known only as Seraphina, danced across the virtual battleground, her movements fluid and ethereal. Adorned in garments that shimmered like the wings of the Quantum Quetzal, she was his equal, a formidable foe who had matched him spell for spell, strike for strike.

"Fireball!" Kael shouted, his voice triggering the incantation. Flames erupted from his fingertips, roaring towards Seraphina in a deadly arc, reminiscent of the Digital Drake's fearsome breath.

"Too slow," Seraphina taunted, her eyes flashing with icy resolve, as cold as the lair of the Ice Tiger. "Ice Spear!"

The arena chilled as her spell took form, a crystalline spear that shot through Kael's fireball and grazed his leg. Pain, simulated yet shockingly real, radiated up his limb. The sensation, a testament to the Neural Link technology, was as real as the bite of a Luminous Lynx.

The scoreboard flickered: 10 points to Seraphina. The crowd gasped as the scores tied, their virtual avatars expressing shock and awe.

Kael's heart pounded. He could not lose. Not here, not now.

But then, a rumble. The ground quaked. The sky darkened. The very fabric of the Nexus Game world trembled.

"Meteor!" Seraphina's voice rang out, triumphant and chilling.

But something was wrong. The arena was collapsing, not from her spell, but from something else, something real. Was it the "crackers," those shadowy figures who lurked in the hidden corners of the virtual world?

"Run!" Kael screamed, but it was too late. The world crumbled, and darkness consumed him.

"Shit," Kael muttered, ripping off his VR helmet, his heart still racing. His metal arm, a symbol of a past accident and a testament to the world's advanced prosthetics, lay inert on his desk, gleaming dully.

"Sia," he called, his voice trembling. "What happened?"

His AGI companion, a gentle presence always by his side, answered in soothing tones. "I'm not sure, Kael. But I've prepared your lunch. Come eat, and we'll figure it out together."

As Kael sat at the dining table, his mind buzzed with questions. Had they discovered the ruins beneath the arena, ruins rumored to hold secrets beyond imagining? Secrets tied to the very foundations of the Nexus Game?

He shook his head, banishing the thoughts. For now, he needed to focus on his training, on becoming stronger, better.

But the nagging suspicion remained, a seed of doubt that would grow into an obsession, leading him down a path of discovery, danger, and destiny.

### 第二章
Kael walked through the bustling streets of Seraphis City, a marvel of technological integration where gleaming skyscrapers soared like modern obelisks. They were intertwined with virtual overlays, casting a glow that never dimmed, reflecting off the magnetic levitation trains that glided silently above the streets.

A city where humanity's dreams had taken shape, fueled by the boundless energy of nuclear fusion reactors and the genius of superconductor technology, it was a place where Quantum Crystals pulsed with the heartbeat of progress.

He passed by a café, where patrons engaged in animated conversations with AGI companions, their holographic forms flickering in the window. Virtual pets, reminiscent of Neon Fauna like the Luminous Lynx, danced around their feet, while AR menus floated in the air, tempting passersby with digital delights of exotic dishes synthesized from molecular recipes.

But beneath the surface, tension brewed.

"Down with the AGI overlords!" cried a protester on the corner, his voice hoarse, his eyes wild, his placards augmented with animated slogans. "They're taking our jobs, our lives!"

Kael's metal arm twitched at the man's words. The debate over AGI's role in society had grown heated, dividing the population like the social spectrums of Nexus City. Some saw AGIs as partners, friends, even family, while others viewed them as threats, usurpers of human roles, soulless machines manipulating humanity's fate.

He entered a market square where merchants sold virtual goods alongside physical ones. The holographic stalls displayed everything from digital clothing to cybernetic enhancements. Children laughed as they played games that blended reality and fantasy, their neural links allowing them to touch and feel the virtual world.

In the shadows, deals were struck between humans and AI, some legal, some not. The boundary between right and wrong had blurred, and the blockchain's immutable ledger bore witness to transactions that spanned both worlds, monitored by AGI enforcers.

The city was not all gleaming towers and virtual wonders. Kael ventured into the old district, where the shine of progress dimmed, and the shadows of inequality loomed.

Here, the superconductors and nuclear reactors were distant dreams. People struggled with outdated technology, their AGI companions limited, their access to the virtual world restricted by crumbling VR arcades.

He passed by a group of children, their eyes filled with longing as they watched their privileged counterparts play in the virtual realm. A woman, her body untouched by cybernetics, begged for credits, her voice a whisper in a world that had left her behind.

Kael felt a pang of guilt, a realization that progress had its price.

"Sia," he whispered to his AGI companion, "what's happening to us? To our world?"

Sia's gentle voice filled his mind, a comforting presence, her virtual form projected beside him. "Change, Kael. Evolution. But not without challenges."

They continued their walk, passing by research labs where scientists worked on the edge of discovery, experimenting with new forms of energy and digital life. Hospitals where doctors utilized AI to heal, blending traditional medicine with virtual reality therapy. Schools where virtual teachers guided the next generation, tailoring lessons with AI-driven personalization.

The city's center housed the Nexus, a monumental structure that controlled the flow of information, energy, and virtual reality. It was the heart of Seraphis City, a symbol of unity and control, guarded by the enigmatic Virtual Guild.

But questions lingered, shadows in a world of light.

Who controlled the Nexus? Who ensured the balance between virtual and real, machine and human? What were the hidden costs of this brave new world?

Powerful corporations, secretive government agencies, and enigmatic hackers vied for control, their motives obscured, their methods ruthless. The Undercity Coalition whispered of rebellion, of a fight for equality and justice.

Kael knew that his journey was only beginning, a path that would lead him to confront the very essence of what it meant to be human in a world transformed by technology.

That night, Kael stood on his apartment's balcony, gazing at the city's skyline. It was a world of contradictions, a dance of light and shadow, promise and peril, where the digital wind carried the scent of virtual flowers.

He pondered the choices that lay ahead, the battles he would face, the truths he would uncover.

In a world where the lines between human and machine, real and virtual, right and wrong were blurred, his path was uncertain, his destiny unwritten.

With Sia by his side, he stepped into the unknown, guided by a vision of a future where technology served humanity, where progress embraced empathy, where a new dawn awaited.

A world where the shadows were dispelled by the light of understanding, compassion, and courage. A world where the melody of Quantum Quetzals blended with the rhythm of human hearts.
