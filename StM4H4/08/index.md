## 三幕劇版
先讓英雄救貓咪的Blake Snyder's "Save the Cat!" Beat Sheet

* Act One: Setup
    1.	Opening Image: Show the state of the world with the peculiar creatures emerging and the gods withdrawing to their realm for safety. This sets the tone for a world in chaos and transition.
    2.	Theme Stated: The theme could be subtly hinted at during these early scenes – perhaps something about balance, the cost of power, or the nature of courage.
    3.	Set-Up: Introduce the protagonist, a human child, whose parents are researchers at the magic university. The chaos caused by the Berserker Kingdom and the malfunctioning barriers.
    4.	Catalyst: The protagonist loses contact with their parents amidst the chaos, leading them to flee, eventually ending up in the Elven Forest.
    5.	Debate: The protagonist, now somewhat older and feeling outcast in the Elven Forest, decides to leave for the Port City. This internal conflict sets the stage for their journey.
* Act Two: Confrontation
    1.	Break into Two: The protagonist's journey from the Elven Forest to the Port City signifies entering a new world - one filled with dangers and opportunities.
    2.	B Story: Introduce a subplot, perhaps involving a group or individual in the Port City that will aid in the protagonist's growth and mirror the main theme.
    3.	Fun and Games: The protagonist takes on a high-paying job to transport supplies but ends up on the front lines of battle, getting knocked out.
    4.	Midpoint: The protagonist is picked up by a dwarf warrior and reluctantly becomes part of the Berserker raids. This is a false victory as the protagonist is safe but at a moral cost.
    5.	Bad Guys Close In: Tension builds as the protagonist's mentor refuses to return to the village, despite a prophecy calling the Berserkers back.
* Act Three: Resolution
    1.	All Is Lost: The protagonist, now separated from the Berserkers, reaches the Empire. The Empire ignores the prophecy, adding to the sense of impending doom.
    2.	Break into Three: The appearance of special monsters from the west and the protagonist's decision to seek knowledge in the Necromancer area marks the final push against the threat.
    3.	Finale: As massive hordes of monsters emerge, the protagonist and allies attempt to use sealing spells. The temporary calm is shattered by the emergence of a black sun and the revival of the Demon God.
    4.	Final Image: The climactic battle with the Demon God. This final image should reflect the change from the opening image and resonate with the theme.
    Remember, while this structure provides a scaffold, it's important to weave character development, world-building, and thematic elements throughout these beats. The protagonist's journey should not just be physical but also emotional and philosophical, reflecting the broader themes of your narrative.

## 日系序破急版
要求AI創造另一個故事但在相同世界觀

* 序 (Jo) - Beginning: A Humorous Set-Up
  1.	World Introduction with a Twist: In a world where peculiar creatures are emerging, and gods are retreating, our protagonist is more concerned about his missing left sock than the mystical chaos unfolding.
  2.	Protagonist's Misadventures: A young, clumsy, yet lovable protagonist is a researcher's child more interested in culinary experiments than magical ones. Their first attempt at a spell accidentally turns their cat into a talking sidekick who constantly offers unsolicited life advice.
  3.	The Catalyst: After a comically disastrous incident involving a spell gone wrong and a berserker who's afraid of chickens, the protagonist's parents disappear, setting them on a quest not just for their parents, but also for their beloved sock.
* 破 (Ha) - Break: Rising Action with Comedic Twists
  1.	Unusual Allies: In the Elven Forest, the protagonist is initially shunned but wins the elves over with their terrible cooking, which, to everyone's surprise, elves find exotic. They befriend an elf who's terrible at archery but great at elven stand-up comedy.
  2.	Misguided Adventures: While attempting to reach the Port City, our protagonist gets lost and ends up in a dwarven underground comedy club, where they accidentally become a hit with their awkward human ways.
  3.	Joining the Mercenaries: The protagonist ends up on the front lines, not as a fighter, but as the mercenaries' cook, turning every battle preparation into a culinary catastrophe that somehow helps them win.
* 急 (Kyū) - Rapid: Climactic Chaos and Resolution
  1.	The Great Misunderstanding: The protagonist discovers they've been carrying the key to controlling the Void Layer all along – their mismatched socks, which are actually powerful magical artifacts.
  2.	Hilarious Showdown: In a chaotic, slapstick-filled battle involving confused gods, talkative monsters, and an army of elves armed with joke arrows, the protagonist and their motley crew face the source of the chaos.
  3.	Heartwarming Resolution: The world is saved in the most unexpected way – through laughter and the accidental heroics of our protagonist. The gods, amused and impressed, help restore balance, and the protagonist's cat decides to stay vocal, providing sassy commentary.
  4.	End with a Chuckle: The protagonist sets off for new adventures, with their talking cat, a sock puppet made from the now-non-magical socks, and a recipe book for disaster.
