## GPT-4
1.	資料考證 Information Validation: 
  * Question: Considering the impact of the Industrial Revolution on the socio-economic landscape, the environment, and labor rights during the 18th and 19th centuries, what were the major technological advancements, their inventors, and the subsequent consequences that shaped the modern world, without access to real-time information?
  * Answer: The Industrial Revolution brought about significant technological advancements, such as the steam engine, spinning jenny, and the power loom. James Watt improved the steam engine in the 1760s, which led to its widespread use in transportation and factories. The spinning jenny, invented by James Hargreaves in 1764, revolutionized textile production, and the power loom, developed by Edmund Cartwright in 1784, further mechanized the weaving process. These innovations transformed the socio-economic landscape by increasing productivity and urbanization, but they also had negative consequences, including environmental degradation, labor exploitation, and growing income inequality.
2.	判斷 Judgment: 
  * Question: Analyze the ethical implications of a hypothetical situation where a company has created a highly effective and safe drug that can cure a rare, life-threatening disease. The company, however, chooses to set an extremely high price for the drug, making it inaccessible to most patients. Evaluate the decision from the perspectives of utilitarianism, deontological ethics, and virtue ethics.
  * Answer: From a utilitarian perspective, the company's decision to set a high price for the drug is unethical, as it would result in greater overall suffering due to the limited access to the drug for patients. Deontological ethics, on the other hand, would argue that the company has a moral duty to provide the drug at a fair price, regardless of the potential financial gain. From a virtue ethics standpoint, the company's decision to prioritize profit over the well-being of patients would be seen as a lack of compassion and empathy, which are essential virtues in ethical decision-making.
3.	創意寫作 Creative Writing: 
  * Question: Compose a short story that takes place in a dystopian future where humans have lost the ability to communicate verbally. The protagonist discovers a mysterious device that restores this ability, leading to unforeseen consequences in a world that has adapted to non-verbal communication.
  * Answer: In a world where humanity had forgotten the beauty of spoken words, society thrived on an intricate system of gestures, facial expressions, and written language. The protagonist, Mara, a historian fascinated by the lost art of verbal communication, stumbles upon a long-forgotten device hidden in the depths of a crumbling library.
Upon activating the device, Mara suddenly regains the ability to speak, her voice echoing in the silent world. Initially thrilled, she quickly realizes the consequences of her newfound power. In a society that had evolved to prioritize privacy and emotional restraint, spoken words are seen as invasive and intrusive. Mara's voice becomes a weapon, inciting fear and suspicion among her peers.
As she navigates the complexities of a society unprepared for her voice, Mara must decide whether to embrace her newfound ability and challenge the status quo or silence herself once again to maintain harmony in a world that has long moved on from the spoken word.
4.	隱喻 Metaphor: 
  * Question: Create a metaphor that represents the delicate balance between technological progress and its potential negative impacts on society, using the concept of a tightrope walker performing on a high wire.
  * Answer: Technological progress is like a tightrope walker delicately balancing on a high wire, suspended between the pillars of innovation and destruction. With each step forward, the tightrope walker risks losing balance and plummeting into the abyss below, representing the potential negative consequences of unchecked advancement. However, when carefully navigating the high wire with precision and caution, the tightrope walker – akin to responsible technological progress – can create a spectacle of wonder and achievement. Each step forward on the wire is a potential for innovation, improving lives and pushing boundaries. But a single misstep could lead to downfall, symbolizing the disruptive effects of technology, such as privacy concerns, labor displacement, or the widening digital divide. Therefore, just as the tightrope walker must maintain a careful balance to prevent disaster, so must society approach technological progress with a keen awareness of its potential impacts, both positive and negative.

## GPT-3
1.	資料考證 information validation
  * Question: In the era of misinformation and fake news, it has become increasingly difficult to ascertain the accuracy and reliability of the information we come across. With the vast amount of data available, how can an AI system ensure the credibility and validity of the information it processes? What methodologies and techniques can it employ to validate data without relying on external sources or the internet?
  * Answer: An AI system dedicated to information validation can employ several methodologies to ensure the credibility and validity of the data it processes, even without relying on external sources or the internet. One approach is through cross-referencing information within its internal knowledge base, comparing and contrasting multiple sources of information to identify discrepancies or inconsistencies. The system can also analyze the context and coherence of the information, assessing whether it aligns with known facts or logical reasoning. By employing advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the AI can identify patterns and linguistic cues that might indicate misinformation or bias. Additionally, the AI can leverage historical data and previous instances of verified information to make informed judgments about new data it encounters, considering the reputation and reliability of the sources. These methodologies, combined with robust algorithms and models, enable the AI system to validate information with a high degree of accuracy and provide reliable insights.
2.	判斷 judgment
  * Question: Human judgment is often influenced by emotions, biases, and personal experiences, which can lead to subjective and flawed decision-making. How can an AI system develop the capability to make objective judgments, considering multiple perspectives, and minimize the impact of biases? Can it go beyond simple rule-based approaches and incorporate ethical considerations into its decision-making process?
  * Answer: Developing an AI system capable of making objective judgments while considering multiple perspectives and minimizing biases is a complex task. To achieve this, the AI system can be trained on diverse datasets, representing various viewpoints and opinions, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, the AI can employ advanced algorithms that detect and quantify biases in data, allowing it to adjust its decision-making process accordingly. By leveraging techniques such as counterfactual reasoning, the AI can simulate alternate scenarios and evaluate the potential consequences of different judgments, enabling a more objective approach. Ethical considerations can be incorporated by providing the AI with a set of predefined ethical principles or guidelines, which it can utilize to assess the moral implications of its judgments. Moreover, the AI can be designed to continuously learn and adapt its decision-making based on feedback from human experts or by analyzing real-world outcomes, thereby refining its judgment capabilities over time.
3.	創意寫作 creative writing
  * Question: Creative writing requires imagination, originality, and the ability to evoke emotions in readers.
