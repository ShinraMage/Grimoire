The Industrial Revolution, beginning around 1760 and continuing into the 19th century, was a period of significant technological advancements that dramatically reshaped society, the economy, and the environment. It began in the United Kingdom before spreading to the rest of Europe and North America. Here are some of the major technological advancements, their inventors, and their subsequent impacts:

1. The Steam Engine: The first practical steam engine was developed by Thomas Newcomen in 1712 to pump water from mines. However, the more efficient version that powered the Industrial Revolution was improved by James Watt in the 1760s. Steam engines revolutionized transportation and industry, leading to the creation of railways and steamships and enabling factories to be built anywhere, not just near water sources.

2. Textile Machinery: Several inventions revolutionized the textile industry, making mass production possible. The Spinning Jenny was invented by James Hargreaves in 1764, the water frame by Richard Arkwright in 1769, and the spinning mule by Samuel Crompton in 1779. These machines dramatically increased the efficiency and output of textile production, leading to the growth of factories and industrial towns.

3. The Power Loom: Invented by Edmund Cartwright in 1784, the power loom mechanized the process of weaving cloth, further improving the efficiency of the textile industry.

4. The Cotton Gin: Invented by Eli Whitney in 1793, the cotton gin automated the process of separating cotton fibers from their seeds, which greatly increased the supply of cotton for the textile industry. This, however, also led to a dramatic increase in the demand for slave labor in the American South to grow and pick the cotton.

5. The Steam Locomotive: George Stephenson developed the first practical steam locomotive in 1814, which led to the creation of the railway system. This revolutionized transportation, allowing for the rapid and efficient movement of goods and people over long distances.

6. The Telegraph: Invented by Samuel Morse in 1837, the telegraph allowed for long-distance communication in real-time (for the standards of the period). This had profound impacts on business, journalism, and personal communication.

These technological advancements brought about significant socio-economic and environmental changes.

Socio-Economically, the Industrial Revolution led to the rise of the factory system and industrial capitalism. The urban population grew as people moved from rural areas to work in factories. This urbanization led to significant social changes, including the rise of the working class and the middle class, and significant social unrest as workers demanded better conditions and rights.

Environmentally, the Industrial Revolution had a significant negative impact. The increased use of coal for steam engines led to air pollution, while the growth of factories and urban areas led to water pollution and deforestation. These environmental changes have contributed to the ongoing challenges of climate change and environmental degradation.

In terms of labor rights, the early Industrial Revolution was characterized by long working hours, low wages, and dangerous working conditions. However, these conditions eventually led to the growth of the labor movement, which fought for workers' rights and eventually led to many of the labor protections we have today, including limits on working hours, minimum wage laws, and the right to form unions.

Finally, it's important to note that the Industrial Revolution was not just about technological advancements. It was also about changes in social and economic structures, including the growth of industrial capitalism, the factory system, and urbanization. These changes, in combination with the technological advancements, are what truly shaped the modern world.
