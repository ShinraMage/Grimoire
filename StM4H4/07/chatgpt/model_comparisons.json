Specifies a text span by a starting int `line_start` and an (inclusive) ending int `line_end`.

If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages.

(Do not apply this guideline to lyrics or recipes.)\nOrganize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you *synthesize* information rather than simply repeating it.\nAlways be thorough enough to find exactly what the user is looking for. In your answers, provide context, and consult all relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.\n\nEXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

the provided links, here's a summary of the information from the two pages:\n\n### Triality:\nIn the fictional setting, Triality refers to a system where technology, elements, and faith are intertwined. The different systems are affected by a factor called Entropy, which influences skill consumption and MP value correction. The Triality system further extends to racial bonuses and skillset mastery within the three systems. Each race has different bonuses in technology, element, and faith. For instance, Humans have a 10% bonus in technology and element, but a -20% bonus in faith, while Dwarves have a -20% bonus in technology but a 10% bonus in both element and faith\u30105\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Attributes:\nAttributes in this setting are categorized into basic attributes and skills. The basic attributes include:\n\n1. **Constitution**: Influences physical combat abilities, affecting health and attack power.\n2. **Perception**: Relates to magical power, magical combat strength, and magical defense.\n3. **Willpower**: Impacts energy or willpower, determining the duration an individual can maintain activities.\n4. **Charm**: Encompasses dialogue capability, understanding, negotiation, bargaining, information retrieval, and organizational skills.\n\nThe skills are categorized into:\n\n1. **Technology**: Includes alchemy, rune symbols, mechanical technology, and ritual mysticism.\n2. **Element**: Divided into water, fire, wind, and earth elements.\n3. **Faith**: Comprises blessings, curses, spirit arts, and immortality arts.\n\nAttributes and skills are influenced by race, level, and learned skills. Practicing a particular skill often leads to proficiency in that skill, while different types of skills are subject to an Entropy effect. Each race has unique characteristics which can be leveraged to magnify certain attributes. For example, Dwarves have a higher constitution due to their physical activities, Elves have a higher perception due to their long lifespan, Humans have higher willpower due to their shorter lifespan and physical shortcomings, and the charm attribute is highest among Humans, followed by Elves and Dwarves.\n\nFurthermore, upon leveling up, a total of 10 points are added to attributes, distributed differently based on racial characteristics\u30109\u2020source\u3011."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "aaa20af8-19d1-44f3-9fb8-ce07f51c90ea", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null}, "create_time": 1697989458.357125, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["merge with the concept\nentropy is the conflict by tech/mage/fath system, is this clear for understand the world setting?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "d2d66d7c-bcf0-42b0-8309-214e9f3e983f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null}, "create_time": 1697989468.252847, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes, it's clear.

A simplistic approach could be the standard deviation of her Triality distribution, which measures the amount of variation from the mean.
