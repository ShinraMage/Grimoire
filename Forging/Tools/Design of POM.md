## What is a Partially Ordered Set?

First, let's introduce the concept of a partially ordered set. In mathematics, this is a set, also known as a directed graph, where if any two points have a relationship, there is a definite direction to that relationship, and that direction cannot be reversed. For example, if 15 < 30 and 1 < 15, then it's impossible for 30 < 1 to exist.

This is called a partial order (only one direction). As shown in the image below, unlike some graphs that can have reversed or bidirectional connections, or even form cycles, none of that occurs within a partially ordered set.

## What is Partially Ordered Magic?

In a game, you can't learn advanced magic without first learning the prerequisite spells. Therefore, "partially ordered magic" represents a skill tree.

## Evolution of the ICON

* Magic + Partial Order + Four Elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind)

* The central part uses a hexagon as a magic gem

* Discarding the body of the arrow

* Randomly adding color

* Placing the four elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind) in the gem position

* Complete! Of course, we need to draw a skill tree diagram.
