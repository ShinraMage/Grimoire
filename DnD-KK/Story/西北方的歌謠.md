# 西北方的民謠-歌謠

```
(Verse 1)
In realms where winter cloaks the earth,
And summer whispers tales of mirth,
Three goddesses, with powers vast,
Guard the present, future, and past.

(Chorus)
Sing high, sing low, in shadows or light,
Three forces of magic, bold and bright,
Their essence woven through each tale,
Guiding us when the dark prevails.

(Verse 2)
Aruna molds the stones and streams,
Selenia sees beyond the dreams,
Chroma in her canvas vast,
Paints the seasons, future and past.

(Bridge)
But darkness rose, a tyrant king,
His shadow cold, a piercing sting,
Disrupting peace, breaking the chain,
Pushing realms to the brink of pain.

(Verse 3)
Angels clashed with might, their fate entwined,
As shadows thickened, hopes declined,
Yet from the ashes rose the flame,
Heroes bearing the goddesses' name.

(Verse 4)
Prophecies foretold of the brave,
With powers three, the world to save,
In their hands, destiny's thread,
Balancing life, keeping darkness at bay.

(Outro)
In this tapestry where magic binds,
Where each heart the goddesses' wisdom finds,
Though shadows linger near and far,
Their legacy lights our path like a star.
